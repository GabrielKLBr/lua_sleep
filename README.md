# What's the purpose of this extension?
Simple, I made it just for fun

# Compiling
**Step 1**: Open the Makefile and change the include and lib location to the directory in your computer

**Step 2**: Run `make` on the Command Prompt and wait until it's done. To use it use `require()` in your lua file with the dll name.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having problems to compile the code, download lib files in the releases tab, and replace the directory in the Makefile to the downloaded lib directory.

That's all to this crappy Markdown.
