# What's the purpose of this extension?
Simple, I made it just for fun

# Compiling
**Step 1**: Open the Makefile and change the include and lib location to the directory in your computer

**Step 2**: Run `make` on the Command Prompt and wait until it's done. To use it use `require()` in your lua file with the dll name.

# Troubleshooting
If you are having problems to compile the code, download lib files in the releases tab, and replace the directory in the Makefile to the downloaded lib directory.

# How to use it
With this extension you get 2 new functions, the `sleep()` and the `sleepM()`. both of these do the same thing, but `sleep()` is the value is in seconds, and `sleepM()` in milliseconds.

That's all to this crappy Markdown.
